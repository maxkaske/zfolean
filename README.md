# zfolean 
An embedding of the syntax of intuitionistic first-order logic over a signature including a natural deduction proof calculus in Lean 3.
We use this to define two set theories ZFC (with only a membership predicate) 
and IZF (with additional function symbols for the empty set, binary pair, union set, powerset and omega)
and give formal proofs of the induction principle over the naturals in both.
