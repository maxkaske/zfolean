# zfolean 
A deep embedding of (intuitionistic) first-order logic with a Natural Deduction proof calculus in Lean.
We use this to define two set theories ZFC (classicaly with only a membership predicate) 
and IZF (with function symbols for the empty set, binary pair, union set, powerset and omega)
and give formal proofs for the induction principle over the naturals.

_Note:_ That we do not give an interpretation of this language, so we work purely syntactically.
