  abstract = {In ordinary lambda calculus the occurrences of a bound variable are made recognizable by the use of one and the same (otherwise irrelevant) name at all occurrences. This convention is known to cause considerable trouble in cases of substitution. In the present paper a different notational system is developed, where occurrences of variables are indicated by integers giving the “distance” to the binding λ instead of a name attached to that λ. The system is claimed to be efficient for automatic formula manipulation as well as for metalingual discussion. As an example the most essential part of a proof of the Church-Rosser theorem is presented in this namefree calculus.}

  abstract = {Often debates about pros and cons of various techniques for formalising lambda-calculi rely on subjective arguments, such as de Bruijn indices are hard to read for humans or nominal approaches come close to the style of reasoning employed in informal proofs. In this paper we will compare four formalisations based on de Bruijn indices and on names from the nominal logic work, thus providing some hard facts about the pros and cons of these two formalisation techniques. We conclude that the relative merits of the different approaches, as usual, depend on what task one has at hand and which goals one pursues with a formalisation.}
